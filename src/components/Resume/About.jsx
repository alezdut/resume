                <p>My name is Alejandro, I am a fullstack developer from Argentina, I am actively searching for challenging projects while continuing my learning. In this global context of a pandemic, I decided to change my profession and focus on development, after having worked for years in personal projects. In view of this goal, I did a BootCamp of more than 700 hours of code, which allowed me to gain important skills in the area of web development both front-end and back-end. The technologies that I feel most comfortable with are ReactJs, Javascript, html, css, postgreSQL and mongoDB. My passions are technology, aviation and audiovisual arts and my hobbies are swimming and traveling.</p>
